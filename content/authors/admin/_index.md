I am a second year Ph.D. student at MIT advised by [Prof. Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html). My current research focuses on two main directions: 1) Understanding and improving how different data sources can be used in robot imitation learning; and 2) algorithmic improvements for generative modeling in robotics. Prior to MIT, I worked on model-based control for contact-rich systems.

I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto where I worked with [Prof. Andreas Moshovos](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~moshovos/000/doku.php). I also spent a formative summer at the University of Pennsylvania where I was advised by [Prof. Michael Posa](https://dair.seas.upenn.edu/).

I am grateful to be funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [NSERC Postgraduate Scholarship (Doctoral)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/index_eng.asp).
